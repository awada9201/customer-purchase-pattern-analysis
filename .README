Hypothesis & Objectives:
Hypothesis 1:
“Customers in higher income brackets spend more per transaction that those in lower income brackets, but their purchase frequency (Total Purchase) is similar”
Objective 1:
“To analyse how income levels affect spending patterns (Amount Spent) and purchase frequency (Total Purchases)”
•	Analysis 1-1: Are “Amount Spent” and “Total Purchases” similar across different income categories?
•	Analysis 1-2: Do high-income customers favour specific “Product Categories” or “Brands”
•	Analysis 1-3: Does “Payment Method” mediate the income spending relationship?

Hypothesis 2:

Objective 2:
“To identify what impacts gender spending patterns”
•	Analysis 2-1: Is there a relationship between gender and customer segmentation?
•	Analysis 2-2: Is there “Income” equality amongst the genders?
•	Analysis 2-3: Do females have a higher purchasing power than males?

Hypothesis 3:
“Electronics (Product Category) have the highest average order value (Amount Spent) but the lowest purchase frequency (Total Purchase)”
Objective 3:
“To rank product categories by profitability (Total Revenue) and customer engagement”

Objective 5:
“To map purchasing power and preferences by geographic region”
•	Analysis 5-1: What are the income levels of customers in each country?
•	Analysis 5-2: Is there a difference in purchasing power (Amount Spent) over the year in each country?
•	Analysis 5-3: Are there regional trends in Product Category preferences?

Hypothesis 6:
“Customers aged 18 – 25 have much higher standards when purchasing products compared to customers who are older”
